# Resume — Mohammed Laroussi

Content lives in `/_data/resume.json`. Edit your data there; the Markdown page (`index.md`) renders it with Liquid. Styles are in `/assets/css/site.css`.

**Deploy**: Push to `main` on a repo named `username.github.io` → Settings → Pages → Source: `Deploy from a branch`.

**PDF**: A GitHub Action builds `resume.pdf` on each push. The page is also print‑optimized.
